# PostgresUserManager

# Setup for running localhost:

1: Clone/Download Repo 
2: Initialize Node 
3: Run Postgres with the default port. I use the database named postgres and the program creates a table called 'Users'
4: Run (node server.js or nodemon server.js) 
5: Open a broswer and navigate to http://localhost (As 80 is the default http port, you shouldn't need to add a port)
